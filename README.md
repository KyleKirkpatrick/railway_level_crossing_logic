This project implements the logic for a railway level crossing system. It provides a control framework for managing the safe operation of railway crossings, including the coordination of barriers, lights, and signals in response to approaching and departing trains. The system is designed to ensure the safety of both rail and road users by automating the detection of trains, activating warning signals, and controlling the opening and closing of crossing barriers.

Key features of the project include:

- Train detection using sensors.
- Automated control of warning lights and audible alarms.
- Logic for lowering and raising barriers safely without harming vehicles or pedestrians.
- State machine design to manage the various operational states of the crossing.
- Test cases to verify correct behaviour under different scenarios.
