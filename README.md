This project implements the logic for a railway level crossing system. It provides a simulation and control framework for managing the safe operation of railway crossings, including the coordination of barriers, lights, and signals in response to approaching and departing trains. The system is designed to ensure the safety of both rail and road users by automating the detection of trains, activating warning signals, and controlling the opening and closing of crossing barriers.

Key features of the project include:

- Simulation of train detection using sensors.
- Automated control of warning lights and audible alarms.
- Logic for lowering and raising barriers based on train proximity and crossing status.
- State machine implementation to manage the various operational states of the crossing.
- Test cases and simulation tools to verify correct behavior under different scenarios.

The project is structured to facilitate understanding, testing, and extension, making it suitable for educational purposes, prototyping, or integration into larger railway control systems.
