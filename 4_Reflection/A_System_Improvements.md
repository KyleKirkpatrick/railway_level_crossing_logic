# System Improvements

- **Sensor Redundancy:** Add redundant sensors to improve reliability and reduce false positives/negatives.
- **Multiple Train Handling:** The current design assumes a single train track with one train at a time. This system could be expanded to handle multiple train tracks and trains traveling in opposite directions.
- **Event Logging:** Implement event logging for diagnostics and incident review.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Allow remote status monitoring and control for traffic authorities.
- **Voice Alert:** Provide instruction to users that are currently obstructing the gate.
