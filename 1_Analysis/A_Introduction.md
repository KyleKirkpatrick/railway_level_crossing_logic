# Introduction

The aim of this project is to design an active system to control gates at a level railway crossing. The system will employ sensors and logic to safely control traffic when a train is travelling through the crossing. The system will autonomously lower gates to restrict traffic while a train is passing, and will feature awareness to ensure the gates do not harm vehicles or pedestrians. I aim to keep the implementation simple to make this an affordable and maintainable solution that is safer than a passive railway crossing.

## Parameters

First, we will define the principal components of the active railway crossing.

### Inputs

- **Distant train presence** - A sensor will be placed a considerable distance away from the crossing to detect when a train is approaching.
- **Near train presence** - A sensor will be placed at the crossing to detect when a train is currently present in the crossing (so we can understand when a train has left the crossing).
- **Gate obstruction detection** - A sensor detects when a vehicle or pedestrian is in the path of the gate.
- **Manual override controls** - A button control panel could allow a traffic authority to operate the crossing's safety mechanism in special cases such as emergencies or equipment malfunctions.

### Outputs

- **Lights** - Safety lights will alert drivers and pedestrians of an approaching train.
- **Bells** - The bells will be rung to provide an audible alert of the approaching train.
- **Siren** - An optional siren could be used to warn a driver that they are obstructing the gate and should vacate the crossing.
- **Gate** - A mechanical gate will be lowered to physically restrict movement through the crossing while a train is passing through.

## Context

Railway crossings are critical points where road and rail traffic intersect, posing significant safety risks if not properly managed. The need for an active system arises from the limitations of passive crossings, which rely solely on signage and user vigilance. The project is set within the broader context of improving public safety, reducing accidents, and ensuring efficient traffic flow.

### Constraints

#### Technical

- **Reliability:** The system must operate with high reliability and fail-safe mechanisms to prevent accidents.
- **Integration:** Compatibility with existing railway signaling and road infrastructure is essential.
- **Maintenance:** The design should allow for straightforward maintenance and diagnostics.
- **Power Supply:** The system must function during power outages, possibly requiring backup power solutions.

#### Economic

- **Cost-effectiveness:** The solution should be affordable for widespread deployment, especially in rural or low-traffic areas.
- **Lifecycle Costs:** Consideration of installation, operation, and maintenance costs over the system's lifespan.

#### Social

- **Accessibility:** The system must be usable and understandable by all road users, including those with disabilities.
- **Public Acceptance:** Community engagement and education may be necessary to ensure proper use and trust in the system.

#### Environmental

- **Sustainability:** Selection of materials and components should minimize environmental impact.
- **Noise Pollution:** Audible alerts (bells, sirens) should be effective but not excessively disruptive to nearby residents.

#### Legal

- **Compliance:** The design must adhere to relevant safety standards, transportation regulations, and accessibility laws.
- **Liability:** Clear protocols must be established for system failures or accidents.

### Stakeholders

- **Railway operators:** Responsible for train operations and crossing safety.
- **Road users:** Drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians who interact with the crossing.
- **Local authorities:** Oversee public safety and infrastructure.
- **Emergency services:** May require manual override access during incidents.
- **Maintenance personnel:** Responsible for system upkeep.
- **Nearby residents:** Affected by system operation, especially noise and traffic flow.

These considerations will guide the design and implementation of a robust, safe, and practical railway level crossing control system.
